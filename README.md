## Virtual DOM

- Uses Virtual DOM for rendering (Virtual DOM:-lightweight copy of real DOM)

* Process Of how Virtual DOM works

- Whenever state changes occurs : - React updates the virtual DOM - Compare the virtual DOM with the previous Real DOM - Updates the only changed UI parts in the Real DOM (Reco)

## Components

- UI block, reusable pices of code
- Functional Components (stateless), Class Components (stateful)
- Functional Components can be made stateful now, with the use of hooks
- Stateless components : UI cannot be updated but state can be updated
- Stateful components : UI & state can be updated
